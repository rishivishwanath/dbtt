### ✅ **Key Features for Project:**  
1. **Match-wise Data** (`match_id`, `season`, `match_no`, `date`, `venue`) → Helps analyze trends across multiple seasons.  
2. **Ball-by-Ball Tracking** (`innings`, `over`, `striker`, `bowler`) → Enables real-time insights.  
3. **Scoring Breakdown** (`runs_of_bat`, `extras`, `wide`, `noballs`, etc.) → Essential for real-time run-rate calculations.  
4. **Wicket Details** (`wicket_type`, `player_dismissed`, `fielder`) → Useful for tracking match-changing moments.  
 
| Requirement | How This Dataset Helps |  
|------------|-------------------------|  
| **Streaming Execution (A)** | You can simulate real-time ball-by-ball data using Kafka & Spark Streaming. Example: **Track live run rates, player performances, and key match events.** |  
| **Batch Execution (B)** | You can aggregate IPL stats across 5 seasons for deeper insights. Example: **Find top run scorers, best bowlers in powerplay/death overs.** |  
| **Comparison (C)** | Compare **real-time match predictions** (win probability) vs. **historical trends** (team performance in chase scenarios). |

# **IPL Ball-by-Ball Analytics Project: Satisfying A, B, and C**

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes **IPL matches (2020-2024)** using a **real-time streaming system** and **batch processing techniques**. It provides insights into player and team performances, detects key match events, and evaluates trends over multiple seasons.

---

## **Satisfying A, B, and C**

### **[A] Streaming Mode Execution (Real-Time Data Processing)**
- **Objective:** Process IPL matches in real-time to track ongoing match statistics.
- **Implementation:** Use **Apache Kafka + Spark Streaming** to simulate live ball-by-ball match updates.
- **Use Cases:**
  1. **Live Run Rate & Win Probability Estimation**
     - Predict which team has a higher chance of winning based on real-time data.
  2. **Key Event Detection**
     - Identify milestones (batsman reaches 50/100, wickets, last-over thrillers).
  3. **Player Performance Tracking**
     - Monitor strike rates, economy rates, and consistency throughout the match.
  4. **Death Over Performance Analysis**
     - Compare team strategies in the last four overs in real-time.

### **[B] Batch Mode Execution (Post-Match & Seasonal Analysis)**
- **Objective:** Perform aggregated analysis on past IPL data to uncover long-term patterns.
- **Implementation:** Store historical data in **PostgreSQL/MySQL** and analyze trends using batch queries.
- **Use Cases:**
  1. **Top Performer Analysis**
     - Identify the best batsmen and bowlers over the 2020-2024 seasons.
  2. **Team Performance Over Time**
     - Compare how teams performed while chasing or defending in past IPL matches.
  3. **Bowler Efficiency in Different Phases**
     - Find the most economical bowlers in powerplay vs. death overs.
  4. **Consistency Analysis**
     - Calculate a player's form across multiple IPL seasons.

### **[C] Comparison & Evaluation (Streaming vs. Batch Mode)**
- **Objective:** Compare the benefits and limitations of real-time and batch processing.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Latency, Accuracy, Use Case Suitability.
- **Comparative Insights:**
  | Query | Streaming Mode (Real-Time) | Batch Mode (Post-Match) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Live Player Stats | Provides instant updates | Summarizes performance post-match |
  | Match Outcome Prediction | Estimates win probability in real-time | Compares historical match outcomes |
  | Batting Strategy | Adjusts insights ball-by-ball | Reviews trends across multiple matches |
  | Bowling Economy Trends | Detects struggling bowlers in real-time | Analyzes seasonal consistency |

## **Tech Stack & Implementation**
- **Streaming:** Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming
- **Batch Processing:** PostgreSQL, Pandas (Python), SQL Queries
- **Visualization:** Power BI / Tableau / Matplotlib (Python)
- **Dataset:** IPL Ball-by-Ball Data (2020-2024)

---

## **Conclusion**
This project **fully satisfies A, B, and C** by demonstrating real-time insights, batch analytics, and a comparative analysis of both approaches. It is **academically strong**, **technically robust**, and **directly relevant to IPL analytics**.

---

### **Next Steps**
- Finalize dataset ingestion for real-time simulation.
- Implement Kafka streaming pipeline.
- Develop SQL queries for batch processing.
- Create a dashboard for visualization.
